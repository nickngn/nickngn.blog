Most of the applications have date time fields created at the moment the code flow run through, so that we can't
pre-calculate the expected datetime in the Unit Tests.

Given a method:

``` java
public A foo() {
    A a = new A();
    // do something
    a.setCreatedDateTime(LocalDateTime.now());
    a.setLastUpdatedDateTime(LocalDateTime.now());
    return a;
}
```

So how do we test the date time?

``` java
@Test
void testFooAuditedDateTime() {
    // Given

    // When
    A a = foo();

    //Then
    assertThat(a.getCreatedDateTime()).isEqualTo(/* something */);
    assertThat(a.getLastUpdatedDateTime()).isEqualTo(/* something */);
}
```

Those will be failed, of course.

Actually, there is no way can we have the exactly expectation of those date time fields. Nonetheless, AssertJ provides us
an API to deal with this case: use approximately datetime - a close moment instead, and that's enough for 99% cases.

We can do it like:

``` java
@Test
void testFooAuditedDateTime() {
    // Given

    // When
    A a = foo();

    //Then
    assertThat(a.getCreatedDateTime()).isCloseTo(new Date(), 100);
    assertThat(a.getLastUpdatedDateTime()).isCloseTo(new Date(), 100);
}
```

Those assertions mean the date time initiated with value closed to the moment which are checked and not over 100 ms.

Besides, AssertJ also provide plenty of other APIs for date assertions as well. See more in:
