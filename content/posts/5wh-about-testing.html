<hr>
<h2 id="1-why-">1. WHY?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Because we don&#39;t want to test all features again every time making changes to the source code.</li>
<li>Because we want to draw a safe circle before changing something to related source code (fix bugs/add features) so that
we know we don&#39;t go over that.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-what-">2. WHAT?</h2>
<h3 id="2-1-what-is-automation-testing-">2.1 What is automation testing?</h3>
<p><code>Who wants to do the same actions after changing every each line of code?</code></p>
<p>You don&#39;t, I don&#39;t, so leave it to the machine, the machine is fast and reliable if we guide it well.</p>
<p>That&#39;s it, the automation testing is a list of guidance - each is for checking the correctness of one requirement for our code/business.</p>
<p>However, depending on the scope, you can choose which type of automation tests. There are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Unit test</strong>: for <code>a piece of code</code>, sounds not cleared, right? - Yes, because there is no definition for the scope of the unit test,
it can be a method, a class, a component, or a feature. However, you can understand implicitly when people talk about the unit test:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unit tests are test cases that are not related to network interactions.
E.g., Test cases handle requests from the Client (HTTP) or queries to the database (JDBC)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Integration test</strong>: In addition to the unit test, the integration test is for test cases that need interactions from outside of the application
or between components.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, we want to test if the user sends requests with no existing URL to the server, then the server has to respond using the error 404.</p>
<p>So why isn&#39;t this case unit test? Because sending an HTTP request often requires the framework and system process, which aren&#39;t under
control and can encounter unexpected errors.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>System test</strong>: While the Integration test is for simple operation test cases, the System test has more than that. You can test
with multiple running services/applications simultaneously to try an operation flow (like a feature).</li>
</ol>
<p>For example: To test a flow of buying product operation, it usually needs stock service, payment service, and authentication service.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>End-to-end</strong>: To test multiple features as individual users likely need all services running for the extensive system, as well as
third-party system.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, Payment with a credit card needs a Merchant system, Visa system, Notification system, Bank system, etc.</p>
<h2 id="3-when-">3. WHEN?</h2>
<p>When it comes to implementing tests, it&#39;s common for newcomers to think that writing tests takes time and should be done
after completing the main code. However, this approach is often flawed.
The timing of test implementation depends on the following tasks:</p>
<h3 id="3-1-refactoring">3.1 Refactoring</h3>
<p>It is crucial to write tests before refactoring. Even experienced developers, including Martin Fowler and Uncle Bob,
emphasize this practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I strongly advise you to learn and using refactoring tools, IDEs like IntelliJ
and Eclipse tools can greatly speed up the process while ensuring accuracy. Features such as Extract method, Rename,
Inline variable, Inline fields,... - most of the refactoring techniques.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="3-2-developing">3.2 Developing</h3>
<p>For feature implementation, tests can be written either after finishing the code or even before (Test Driven Development approach).</p>
<h3 id="3-3-fixing-bugs">3.3 Fixing bugs</h3>
<p>Similar to refactoring, it is recommended to cover related cases with tests.
Reproducing bugs through failed tests allows for confident bug fixing, ensuring that the issue does not resurface.</p>
<p>By considering the specific tasks at hand, writing tests at the appropriate times ensures better code quality,
prevents regressions, and supports efficient development and bug fixing processes.</p>
<h2 id="4-where-">4. WHERE?</h2>
<p>This is the project structure I often use for projects:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-scss">project-root/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── main/
  │   │   ├── java/             (source <span class="hljs-selector-tag">code</span> directory)
