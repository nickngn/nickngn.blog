## 1. WHY?

- Because we don't want to test all features again everytime making changes to source code.
- Because we want to draw a safe circle before changing something to related source code (fix bugs/add features) so that
  we know we don't go over that.

## 2. WHAT?

### 2.1 What is automation testing?
`Who want do the same actions after changing every each line of code?`

You don't, I don't, so leave it to the machine, the machine is fast and reliable if we guide it well.

That's it, the automation testing is a list of guidance - each of them is for checking correctness of one requirement for our code/business.

However, depend on the scope then you can choose which type of automation tests. There are:

1. **Unit test**: for `a piece of code`, sounds not cleared, right? - Yes, because there is no definition for scope of unit test,
it can be a method, a class, a component or a feature. However, you can understand implicitly when people talk about Unit test:

    > Unit tests are test cases which are not related to network interactions.
    Eg: Test cases handle request from Client (HTTP) or query to database (JDBC)

    More examples in [Unit test with Spring Boot](/unit-test-with-spring-boot)

2. **Integration test**: As addition for unit test, integration test is for test cases need interactions from outside of application
    or between components.

    For example: we want to test if user send request with not existed URL to server, then server have to respond user the error 404.

    So why isn't this case unit test? Because sending an HTTP request often requires framework and system process, which aren't under
    control and can encounter unexpected errors.

    More examples in [Integration test with Spring Boot](/integration-test-with-spring-boot)

3. **System test**: While Integration test is for simple operation test cases, then System test have more than that. You can test
    with multiple running services/applications at once to test an operation flow (like a feature).

    For example: To test a flow of buying product operation, normally it needs: stock service, payment service, authentication service

4. **End-to-end**: To test multiple features as individual users, it needs likely all services running for the big system, as well as
    third-party system.

    For example: Payment with credit card needs: Merchant system, Visa system, Notification system, Bank's system, etc.

## 3. WHEN?

### 3.1 Refactoring?

### 3.2 Developing?

### 3.3 Fixing bugs?

## 4. WHERE?

## 5. HOW?
