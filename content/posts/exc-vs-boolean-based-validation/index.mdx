## What is exception based validation?

```java
class SyntaxValidator {

    public void validate(String value) {
        try {
            checkSyntaxA(value);
            // others
        } catch (SyntaxException e) {
            // handle exception e
        }
    }

    private void checkSyntaxA(String value) {
        if (value == null) throw new SyntaxException(INPUT_NOT_NULL);
        // other logic checks
    }
}
```
Exception based validation is methodology to throw exception each time the happy case condition isn't met.
It relies on higher level caller to know and handle it for them.

In the real life. it's like: the travel agent asks you to fill the form, and when you fill something incorrectly, you
tell the agent about that, so that the agent can handle it for you.

## What is boolean based validation?
```java
class SyntaxValidator {

    public void validate(String value) {
        if (!checkSyntaxA(value)) {
            // do something
        };
        // others
    }

    private boolean checkSyntaxA(String value) {
        if (value == null) return false;
        // other logic checks
    }
}
```

Boolean based validation is methodology to return boolean: true if all checks in method is valid, and vice versus.

## How to use?

|                          | Exception-based                       | Boolean-based                                                |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| When caller know result? | Immediately when the condition failed | Controllable to return immediately or in the end of function |
| Performance              | Lower slightly                        | Higher slightly                                              |
| Readability              | Well-through                          | Multiple if-else continuously                                |

### When to use?

It is normally suggested to not use Exception based validation commonly in your code, instead of it, it's better to use
boolean-based solution because it's safer to use commonly and work correctly in all areas of your project.
Although you have to pay with a bit of readability but the conditions are easy to modify.

On the other hand, exception-based solution can enhance the flow and shorten code, but if you don't wrap method carefully
then the container class will be a mess.

However, everything has its correct way for its correct moment, I do believe in that. <br/>
As my experiment, Exception-based is
good to use when you need a big validation module (a validator class / a package for validating), so that you can have a
natural wrapper (class/package) and there is only limited number of ports (public validation methods), that mean except
allowed ports, you have to set all modifiers for others to be default or private.

## Extension: Notification based
The idea to wrap the error detail in the object and return.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;

class ValidationResult {
    private final List<String> errorList = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addErrors(String... errors) {
        errorList.addAll(Arrays.asList(errors));
    }
    public void addErrors(ValidationResult result) {
        errorList.addAll(result.errorList);
    }

    public boolean hasErrors() { return !errorList.isEmpty(); }
}
```

And how to use it:
```java
class SyntaxValidator {

    public void validate(String value) {
        if (checkSyntaxA(value).hasErrors()) {
            // do something
        };
        // others
    }

    private boolean checkSyntaxA(String value) {
        ValidationResult result = new ValidationResult();
        if (value == null) result.addErrors(INPUT_NOT_NULL);
        // other logic checks
        return result;
    }
}
```
