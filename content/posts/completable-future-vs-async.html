<hr>
<p>CompletableFuture &amp; @Async are often used for asynchronous processing purpose, this maybe the
biggest similarity and questionable confusion when people think about selection.</p>
<p>However, they are used differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>CompletableFuture is used mostly with chained methods and callbacks.</li>
<li>@Async is used in application as the same way with other method calls, but CgLib made the
magic to wrap the object marked with @Async, and run it on another thread.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that, deciding carefully what you want bases on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this method always processed asynchronously? If yes, feel free to mark @Async on it (better to impl method if there is also interface)
or else you know you should choose the other way.</li>
<li>Do we have callbacks to handle after the main process finished?</li>
</ul>
