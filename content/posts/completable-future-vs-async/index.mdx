CompletableFuture & @Async are often used for asynchronous processing purpose, this maybe the
biggest similarity and questionable confusion when people think about selection.

However, they are used differently:
- CompletableFuture is used mostly with chained methods and callbacks.
- @Async is used in application as the same way with other method calls, but CgLib made the
magic to wrap the object marked with @Async, and run it on another thread.

So that, deciding carefully what you want bases on:
- Is this method always processed asynchronously? If yes, feel free to mark @Async on it (better to impl method if there is also interface)
or else you know you should choose the other way.
- Do we have callbacks to handle after the main process finished?
